A) INFORMATION GATHERING
1) Look at the man page for the "open()" sycall, found in section 2 of the manpages:

man 2 open

A) BUGS:
    Currently, it is not possible to enable signal-driven I/O by specifying O_ASYNC when calling open(); use fcntl(2) to enable this flag.
    One must check for two different error codes, EISDIR and ENOENT, when trying to determine whether the kernel supports O_TMPFILE functionality.
    When both O_CREAT and O_DIRECTORY are specified in flags and the file specified by pathname does not exist, open() will create a regular file (i.e., O_DIRECTORY is ignored).

B)  Files needed to be included:
    the file specified by pathname (it may be created if it does not exist)
    Any flags

C) The first 3 related sycalls:
    Not sure exactly what this refers to, as there is no section in this man marked "related." However, the first three in the SEE ALSO section are:
    chmod
    chown
    close

    in the Synopsis section of the manpage, the three commands listed are open, creat, and openat.

D)  One of the system calls listed above, I am chosing chmod
    BUGS: no bugs listed
    required files: pathname, mode

2) "Usb_device" is defined as a struct in "usb.h".

A)  The first 5 members of the struct are:
    int     devnum;
    char    devpath[16];
    u32     route;
    enum usb_device_state   state;
    enum usb_device_speed   speed;

B)  The typedef for "Enum usb_device_speed" is in "ch9.h".

C)  The entire enumeration declaration for "usb_device_speed" is:
    enum usb_device_speed {
    	USB_SPEED_UNKNOWN = 0,  			/* enumerating */
    	USB_SPEED_LOW, USB_SPEED_FULL,		/* usb 1.1 */
    	USB_SPEED_HIGH,		        		/* usb 2.0 */
    	USB_SPEED_WIRELESS,	        		/* wireless (usb 2.5) */
    	USB_SPEED_SUPER,	        		/* usb 3.0 */
    	USB_SPEED_SUPER_PLUS,	    		/* usb 3.1 */
    };


B) BASIC LINUX USE:
1) Logged in
2) Found text editor
3) Found the terminal
4) Studied the Learning the shell
5) Installed script
6) Scripted commands
7) Installed Gedit, relocated typescript to HW file

C) BASIC C PROGRAMMING IN LINUX
    Didn't have script on for the programming part, only for execution

    gdb!!!
    break <linenum>
    break <function>
    step with <s>
    <c> to continue

D) Hello, Kernel:
    hello.c
